XP Tracker: Experience tracker to gamiify your everyday working life :)

Project Description:
This is a php-html project helping you reflect on your growth in your everyday work life. The solution works using the growth mindset principle (See Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck) where the focus is that an individual's abilities are not fixed (for example I am a talented/ untalented coder). Instead in growth mindset, you believe that you are capable of growing and developing - thus the questions make you think "what did I learn", "what foe did I defeat". The question "How did I improve group standing were?" was to encourage a sense of team spirit as each individual considered how they helped represent the team. While "Did you have fun?" was added to make you think of the positive moments of the workday before you ended your work day.

Technologies used: Php, Html. 
It was chosen, mostly since I wanted to specifically want on a PHP project and I had some basic learning of PHP/Html. 
This a currently very simple version - data is locally stored in a text file. 
To make the project more accesible in the future, I would need to consider if I can replace the format from a webpage (which requires hosting knowledge) to a console application so that more of my non-tech friends can also use it :)

How to Install and Run the Project:
Download the files
Download/set up a hosting service - for example XAMP/MAMP for local hosting
View page by hosting it. 
Webpage has three questions that you answer. Answers are stored in a text file. 

Developing is pretty simple - no special libraries were used.

Credits:
- Questions "Did you learn something new?", "Did you defeat a formidable foe?" and "Did you improve the group standing?" were first introduced to me in a DnD (Dungeons and dragons) game. Even the concept that answering "yes" to those questions leads to xp was completely taken from this context.

- Applying them to a work setting was my own contribution. As well as adding in "did you have fun?"

- Credit also goes to my coworkers Henrik, Kevin, Mattias and Christian for guiding me and inspiring me!
- Project was made in my own free time. 
- Made at the Gambit Office as well as the beautiful city of Vasa, Summer of 2021.
